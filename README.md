# Covert Communication

## Overview
Designed a covert communication channel using pseudorandom LSB image steganography, encoding data across RGB channels based on a PRNG seed and documenting the approach in a publishable research paper.

---

## My Role
- Developed pseudorandom encoding scheme for RGB image channels
- Implemented Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography techniques
- Built scripts to encode and decode secret messages
- Built script to print metrics of original vs encoded image
- Conducted testing to ensure robustness and security of the covert channel
- Documented methodology and results in a professional report
